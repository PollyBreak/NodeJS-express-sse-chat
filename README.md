# NodeJS-express-sse-chat
Simple chat written with express and sse-express.

Launch Instructions:
1. Clone this repository.
2. Open it in IntelliJ IDEA or VisualStudio Code as a project.
3. Probably you will have to install necessary modules (express and express-sse). If you use IntelliJ IDEA you can just hover on "express" and "express-sse"
   in "var express = require('express'); var SSE = require('express-sse')" (first two lines in server.js) and IntelliJ will offer to install them.
   If you use VisualStudio Code you should write '$ npm install express --save' and '$ npm install express-sse --save' in the terminal.
4. Run the file server.js.
   '$ node server.js'
